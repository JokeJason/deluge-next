# deluge-next

A modern web frontend for the [Deluge](https://deluge-torrent.org/) BitTorrent client, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query), [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

**deluge-next** addresses performance issues in the default Deluge Web UI when managing large numbers of torrents (500+).

## Features

- Fast and responsive UI for large torrent lists
- Modern React-based architecture
- User authentication via Clerk
- Powerful filtering and sorting capabilities
- Real-time torrent status updates
- Customizable table views

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version specified in `.nvmrc`)
- pnpm (installed via `npm install -g pnpm`)
- A running Deluge instance with Web UI enabled
- Clerk account for authentication

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jokejason/deluge-next.git
   cd deluge-next
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

   Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and update the values:
